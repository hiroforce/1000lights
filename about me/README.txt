# All about you #

We'd like to know more about you. So drop your resume in here.



Got a cool web app you've built? Link us to it.

	Check out Clipsyndicate.com. That is largely the same code as it was when I left that company. Looks like they may have added some new advertisement providers but that's about it. I've done mostly work for advertising agencies lately which in my mind don't really fall under the realm of an app. Corporate presence, film/book advertising, etc..

	 -On my own time I'm building an android game I call "pub crawler" which uses Rails as a web service. You can currently play around with the webservice that queries a database of all establishments in texas with a liquer license. Once I have this app to a fairly polished state I'll expand to all 50 states then eventually other locales abroad.

	The rails service can be accessed @ http://radiant-ridge-5519.herokuapp.com/locations/list?dst=5&lat=32.649775&lng=-97.161112&type=BAR 

	the query can be modified where dst = distance from the lat (lattitude co-ordinates) and lng (the longitude coordinates). The potential topes are BAR, RESTAURANT, GROCERY, and blank for all types at once.

Got a Hacker News account full of snarky/insightful comments? Rad. We want to read those snarky/insightful comments.

	It's been a while since I've run a blog, but soon I will start one because I have a for fun project of building a life sized TARDIS which will have working lights and doors that run on motors. The TARDIS is powered by a Raspberry Pi series B running and apache webserver and PHP/Python webservice. I'll then make an native android app to access the webservice and control the... TARDIS. Stay tuned. I set up the raspberry pi, need to buy lumber sometime this week.

Got a GitHub account? We'll probably actually figure that out from the pull request. Don't worry about that one.

	Ok, not worried.
